# Stanford_CS230_Final_Project_
This is for 2024 fall CS230 final project by Arya P.Antony

The application uses a BERT-based model to compare names in transaction data with names from a sanctions list and flag potentially sanctioned entities. 
The code will include the following steps:

**Data Preparation:** We'll prepare a dataset with names from both the sanctions list and transaction data.
**Model Design:** We'll fine-tune a pretrained BERT model to classify whether the names in transaction data match those in the sanctions list.
**Training and Evaluation:** Train the model and evaluate its performance.

**Prerequisite:**
pip install pandas torch transformers sklearn
